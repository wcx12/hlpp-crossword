## Algorithm

The crossword generator uses a greedy algorithm:

1. Place the first word (longest) at a random position
2. For remaining words, find intersection points using `letCoords` mapping
3. Score each possible position based on:
   - Base score of 1
   - +1 for each intersection with existing letters
4. Place words at the highest-scoring positions within time limit
5. Keep the best solution (most words placed)
